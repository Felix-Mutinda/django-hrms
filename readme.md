# Django Human Resource Management System #
  
An **HRMS** which supports two kind of users:  
    1. **Employer**  
    2. **Employee**  
An Employer Creates an account and specifies his company name, role/position  
and the total number of employees. He also creates user accounts for his  
employees, manages a database of **company assets**, he can **assign/re-assign**  
assets to his employees and has a recored of which asset is assigned to  
which employee.  
Employees can edit their profiles but never their role/position.  
Employers will get **realtime notifications** on the activities of their employees  
while on the system (i.e *logging in, updating/editing profiles and logging out*).
